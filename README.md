# BTCvis

A real-time market price ticker for the luno btc exchange.

A very simple implementation in Python. Just pulls JSON information from LUNO's endpoint with their API, and displays it.

Had plans for more statistical analysis features and notification alerts but scrapped it due to the crypto market crashing and lost interest.
